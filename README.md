### How does it work : 

when you start the game, it will ask you to choose what kind of words do you want to play lik animals and numbers, 
then after you choosed one of them the game will choose one of the suggested words or numbers by a random way and  
you have to guess it, so if the aswer is correct the arrow will move to the 'True' signal and if it's wrong answer
the arrow will move to the 'False' signal.
